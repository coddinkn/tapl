A repo dedicated to implementations of languages described in TaPL, ([Types and Programming Languages] (https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/)), as well as any other exercises related to type theory.
This repo is also intended as a way to get more familiar with the language Haskell, strong type systems, and functional programming in general.
